# 📦 packtxt — Convert Any Folder Into One Clean Text File

packtxt is a fast and lightweight CLI tool that converts your entire folder into **one clean text file**.  
Perfect for sharing full codebases with AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or Copilot.

---

## 🔥 Why packtxt?

AI tools work best when they receive **complete, structured context**, but developers face problems like:

- Too many files to copy manually  
- ZIP files cannot be read by AI  
- Missing files break AI understanding  
- Multi-file debugging becomes difficult  
- File boundaries get mixed  
- AI hallucinates when context is incomplete  

packtxt solves this by generating **one AI-ready text file** with clear file separation.

## 💡 What Does packtxt Actually Do?

packtxt takes every file in your folder and structures it like this:

```
--- intro.js ---
console.log("This is intro file")

--- about.js ---
console.log("This is about file")

--- contact.js ---
console.log("This is contact file")
```

This ensures AI always knows:
- Which file starts where  
- Which file ends where  
- How the project is structured  

---

## 📁 Example Folder Structure

```
project/
 ├── intro.js
 ├── about.js
 └── contact.js
```

---

## 📄 Example File Contents

**intro.js**
```javascript
console.log("This is intro file")
```

**about.js**
```javascript
console.log("This is about file")
```

**contact.js**
```javascript
console.log("This is contact file")
```

---

## 🧾 Final Output (Generated by `npx packtxt`)

```
--- intro.js ---
console.log("This is intro file")

--- about.js ---
console.log("This is about file")

--- contact.js ---
console.log("This is contact file")
```
